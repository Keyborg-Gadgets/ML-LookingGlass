# Literally Anything Welcome
I'll list some things I need. But what do you think? This project is undeniably cool. Rough around the edges though. Any improvement welcome. Build simplicity and complexity must remain minimal. For example, I'm going to use FixStars cuda-efficient-features. But I have to pull out all that opencv because building and distributing opencv and cuda will kill me. So if you say want to add an off the shelf component from another platform, It really should be native cuda. I'm not opposed to opencv, then I need the build system for it too. 

# Cleanup
This is easy points for anyone that wants them. One day this project might be cool and your name will be on a cool project. Right now global need to go to their own headers. I still don't want classes. Everything still needs to be it's tangible raw item. I'm already having issues with that, but thats the engineering goal. It's an architecture demo.

So you just paste the globals into chatgpt, then you paste in a file and say create initializations for all of these methods based on the previously provided globals. The should self initialize from the globals if not set when called.

precedence is given to the local variable, we keep the copy paste global nature of the file, while providing a clean interface for those who want to OO further. It's also a code Architecture Demo. My commits are ugly, I'll squash it eventually. But thats not even the point. Code quality matters, but that is not this thesis.

# If you nab it
I'm working on a new multi object algo in this repo too. If you do nab it, reference me please. I need the visibility. I think it's going to be cool and if you see where it's going and you get there first just shout me out.
